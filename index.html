          Yim Wing-Chun was taught fujian shaolin kung fu by monks.  During a raid a warlord saw Yim and wanted to make her his bride.  She challenged the warlord
          to hand-to-hand combat.  If he won, she would be his wife.  If she won, the warlord and all his soldiers would leave the monastery and never return.
          After much laughter, the warlord agreed, even granting Yim a month to train for the fight.</p>
        <p>  Yim set off immediately into the bamboo forest to train.  During her trek through the forest she came across
          a snake and a crane locked in mortal combat.  So enthralled was Yim, with the deadly grace at which both creatures fought, that she decided to modify her own
          style.  Yim spent the entire month practicing her few new moves, from sunrise to sunset, until her muscles were well use to the movements. </p>
        <p>  When the warlord returned Yin faced him with shoulders squared and chin held high.
          The ensuing fight was long and visuous, but with Yim's newfound, straightforward style she defeated the warlord, even with his advantageous strength and weight.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:white; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 50px">Wing Chun's most famous Grand Master: Ip Man</h2>

            style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 15%;">
      <div style="color: white; text-align: center; text-indent: 5%; letter-spacing: 2px;">
        <p>Ip Man(Yip Man) was born into a wealthy merchant family in Foshan, Guangdong, where he was trained by monks in the wushu(kung fu) style of Wing Chun(Ving Tsun).  After
           he mastered Wing Chun he was sent to Hong Kong to study at St Stephen's College.</p>
        <p>When his education was complete, Ip man returned to Foshan to run the family bussiness.  Ip eventually married Cheung Wing-sing, and had two sons: Ip Chun and Ip Ching, and
           two daughters: Ip Nga-sum and Ip Nga-wun.  Eventually Ip would go on to start the Ving Tsun Athletic Association, lose his wealth and varies bussinessess fighting the communism
           that took over china's government, and eventually die from throat cancer caused by his smoking habit.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about Ip Man is that he trained Bruce Lee.  At the time Bruce Lee was trained in Wing Chun Ip was away trying to undermine the communist regime,
           while getting the Ving Tsun Athletic Association up and running.  While Ip Man undoubtedly attended some of Bruce's training sessions, the bulk Lee's training was conducted
           by a few of Ip's senior students, which was common practice for the time.
